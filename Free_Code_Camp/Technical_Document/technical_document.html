          This document is all about what I have Googled while learning code.
          This is a living document that will be consistently added to as I go.
          While Google is a great resource for me, I find myself searching for
          the same topic more than once. This takes time out of my coding
          because I am searching for the main document I found the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          By creating this document, I will put all of my searches in one place
          with answers to my questions. I will first explain why I needed help.
          Then show the query, give the site, and give the solution. I will
          provide an explanation if needed.

          While using Git, I accidentally used a single apostrophe (') to start
          and a double apostrophe ("). This created an error on my terminal, and
          I was not able to exit out of it. There was no error message just a
          ">" and a cursor. After keyboard mashing, I decided to look it up.
          Below is an example of my code and the error.
        </p>
        <code id="git_commit">
          git commit -m 'Add some file to project" <br />

          I found that when I clicked on an anchor link, the page would scroll
          to the wrong part of the section. The top of the section would be cut
          off by the navbar. This was not a good user experience since the user
          would need to scroll up to see the titles.

          While I found the answer on the above link, it didn't work correctly
          for me. I did however, find the code in the comments worked better but
          was not perfect. Below is the the suggested code and the code I
          actually used:

        <h3>Breakdown why this works</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>:before - This inserts content before the selected element</li>
          <li>content: ''; - There needs to be content to occupy space</li>
          <li>
            display: block; - This makes the content, inserted by the "before:",
            push all other sections to a new row.
          </li>
          <li>
            height: 75px: - This is the size of the navbar that is fixed to the
            top.
          </li>
          <li>
            margin-top: -75px: - Without this in the css, this creates even more
            space in between the sections.

        <p>
          I am using a Mac and using Visual Studio Code. I was making a list of
          bullet points and realized that I wanted to change the order of the
          list. I could have gone with the cut and paste route but I knew there
          was a shortcut.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Search: "visual studio code shortcut to move line"</li>
          <li>

          <p>
            the site that is referenced above is from Visual Studio Code. There
            is an anchor tag on it that links to the part of the page with many
            basic editing shortcuts. Will need to reference this to make editing
            faster.

          <h2>Center Vertically & Horizontally - Using Flexbox</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          I had a section of text that I wanted to be center both horizontally
          and vertically in a div using css. I found a that the flexbox was the
          best way of doing this.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Search: "css image center in div"</li>
          <li>
            Site:

            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I found the answer on W3schools.com. By using the flexbox, we get more
          options to align elements using css. While their example worked, I
          changed it around to work for my specificy example.
        </p>
        <div class="suggested_used">
          <div class="code_example">
            <h4>Suggested</h4>

              .center {
              <ul>
                <li>display: flex;</li>

                <li>border: 3px solid green;</li>
              </ul>
            </code>
          </div>
          <div class="code_example"></div>
          <h4>Used</h4>
          <code>
            .center {

              <li>padding-bottom: 75px;</li>
            </ul>
          </code>
          <p>
            I ended up using close to the same code as the example with a few
            changes. Since I was using a nav-bar that was fixed and 75px high, I
            needed to add padding at the bottom.
          </p>
          <h3>Breakdown why this works</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>display: flex; - created a flexbox for the element</li>
            <li>
              justify-content: center; - This places the content in the center
              horizontally
            </li>
            <li>
              align-items: center; - This places the content in the center
              vertically.
            </li>
            <li>
              height: 400px: - This sets the size of the div and since the
              iframe I used was 315px it sat nicely in the middle
            </li>
            <li>
              margin-bottom: 75px: - This was used to compensate for the nav-bar
              offset.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
